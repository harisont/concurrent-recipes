A complete hot winter meal. [Better than a vocal warmup](https://harisont.github.io/assets/audio/broccoli.mp3).

## Ingredients

- broccoli
- potatoes
- hard cheese, preferably grana
- breadcrumbs
- oil
- salt
- pepper
- eggs

## Equipment

- oven
- microwave (optional, but it speeds things up significantly)
- microwave- and oven safe bowl
- grater

## Steps

1. pre-heat the oven at 200 C
2. - 1. wash, peel and cut the potatoes into bite sized pieces (if you don't want to throw away the peel, [try turning into a snack while the oven is still hot!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srkg2KQpgr8&t=177s))
     2. put the potatoes in a bowl and microwave them for about 5 minutes. If you don't have a microwave, boil them until they start to soften slightly
   - wash and cut the broccoli head into pieces of about the same size of the potato bits
3. add the broccoli to the bowl and microwave everything for another 5-10 minutes. If you don't have a microwave, you can skip this step
4. grate an abundance of the cheese into a smaller bowl
5. mix the cheese with the same amount of breadcrumbs
6. add the mixture to the larger bowl and add some oil, salt and pepper. Mix everything together.
7. move the bowl into the oven.
8. - let it bake until the potatoes are soft and breadcrumbs have browned (the amount of time this takes varies depending on whether or not the vegetables have been microwaved). At some point in the process, take the bowl out of the oven and mix
   - snack on broccoli stem
9. - take the bowl out of the oven and let it cool down slightly
   - fry one egg per person
10. plate the vegetables with an egg on top, dressing with some more salt and pepper
