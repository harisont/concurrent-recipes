With adequate toppings, this beet + potato soup can taste pretty good, but the real reason to make it is that looks very pink. That doesn't change if you add carrots to the mix.

## Ingredients
- red beets
- potatoes
- vegetable broth
- onion(s)
- bay leaves
- (olive) oil
- salt
- pepper
- toppings of your choice (recommended: pumpkin seeds and bread croutons)

### Optional
- carrots
- unsweetened yogurt or sour cream
- cheese to grate

## Equipment
- hand blender

## Steps
1. - chop the onion finely and sauté it in some oil inside a tall pot
   - dice the vegetables

2. - add the vegetables to the pot and stir for about 5 minutes
   - warm the broth up

3. - pour the broth into the pot and bring it to a boil. Let everything cook for at least 15-20 minutes, until both the beets and the potatoes are soft
   - grate a generous amount of cheese

4. turn off the stove and blend everything together
5. add toppings and season with salt, pepper and optionally some extra oil and a bit of yogurt or sour cream
